This repository contains the source code for a sample website for a fictitious company called **ACME Fishing Logistics**. The website is based on the use case example from the book, [Automated Machine Learning on AWS](https://www.packtpub.com/product/automated-machine-learning-on-aws/9781801811828?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781801811828), published by Packt, and will form the foundation on which to further build automated generative AI features on AWS. Essentially, deploying this sample website will enable you to pick up from where the book left off, and leverage the supplemental content, from **[www.automatedmlonaws.com](https://www.automatedmlonaws.com/)**, to add additional generative AI functionality to the website.
